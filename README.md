# Legion-Project

An interactive chatbot using a lot of scuffed modules and it is sorta similar to Alexa. However, it’s still a prototype and there still a lot of features limitation. So far, it can do two things it can respond like chat gpt when a question is asked or it can search up on google about a topic if a response is not a question. So thats that. To activate the chat bot, I use a key word “Legion five”, then the chatbot will be activated. I attached a video of this project
