# Legion-Project

An interactive chatbot utilizing numerous outdated modules, it is somewhat similar to Alexa. However, it’s still a prototype, and there are still a lot of feature limitations. So far, it can do two things: it can respond like ChatGPT when a question is asked, or it can search on Google about a topic if a response is not a question. So that's that. To activate the chatbot, I use the keyword “Legion five”, then the chatbot will be activated. Attached to this repository is a video of me explaining how this chatbot works.
